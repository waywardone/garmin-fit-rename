# garmin-fit-rename


## About

I've used Garmin devices to track my physical activities for a number of years and am generally happy with them for that purpose. I have been annoyed by the file naming conventions used when data is exported from the devices. This is a utility that renames the FIT files to use a more human readable name that provides a chronological context at a glance. Currently, it handles file naming conventions from two models that I have access to - a Forerunner 235 and a Forerunner 645.



## Usage


```sh
.\garmin-fit-rename.ps1 -SRCDIR C:\Path\To\Directory\With\FITFiles
```
